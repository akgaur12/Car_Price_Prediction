# Car Price Prediction Project

Welcome to the "Car Price Prediction" project repository! This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to predict the prices of cars based on various attributes and features. Whether you're a data enthusiast, a beginner in machine learning, or someone curious about predicting car prices, this project provides valuable insights and practical experience.

## About the Project

In this project, we aim to build and evaluate machine learning models that can accurately predict car prices. By leveraging a diverse dataset containing information about different car models, manufacturers, specifications, and historical prices, we'll explore various algorithms and techniques to create a robust prediction model.

## What's Included

- Code implementations and Jupyter Notebooks showcasing data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.
- Datasets used for training and testing the models.
- Visualizations to better understand the data and model performance.
- Documentation and insights into the steps taken to create the prediction model.

## Features

- Dataset Exploration: Understand the dataset, its attributes, and patterns within the car data.
- Data preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze and visualize the relationships between different features to gain insights into the data.
- Model selection: Experiment with different regression algorithms, such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- Model evaluation: Use appropriate evaluation metrics, such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), to assess the performance of the models.
- Hyperparameter tuning: Optimize model performance by tuning hyperparameters using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
